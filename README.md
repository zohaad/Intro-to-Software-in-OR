# Intro to Software in OR (Operations Research)

In this project I use IBM's [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/details) library to solve linear programs, my write-up can be found [here](https://github.com/zohaad/Intro-to-Software-in-OR/blob/master/ZohaadFazal_report.pdf).

The Assignments it solves (A0, B0, C0, and D0) can be found [here](https://github.com/zohaad/Intro-to-Software-in-OR/blob/master/Assignments.pdf).

| Assignment code | Problem title                   | Source code                  |
| --------------- |---------------------------------| -----------------------------|
| A0              | Investment Plan I               | InvestmentPlan.java          |
| B0              | Capacitated Facility Location I | CapacitatedFacility.java     |
| C0              | The Bin Packing Problem         | BinPacking.java              |
| D0              | Facility Location               | FacilityLocation.java.       |

The java files can be found [here](https://github.com/zohaad/Intro-to-Software-in-OR/tree/master/src/main/java). Note that Timeable.java is used for C0 and D0.
