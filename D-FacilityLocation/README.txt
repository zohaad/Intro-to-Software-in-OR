This folder contains instances for assignment D.

An instance consists of a undirected graph G with n vertices (labelled from 1 to n), and m undirected arcs.
Each arc ij has a non-negative real weight w(i,j).

The input format of the instances is as follows

instanceName
n
m
i1 j1 w(i1,j1)
i2 j2 w(i2,j2)
.
.
.
im jm w(im,jm)

Thus every instance file will consist of m+3 lines.
Example of an instance called "instance1" 6 nodes and 9 arcs.
